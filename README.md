# HippocampusSegmentation
This is a colab notebook that uses a UNET to semantically segment the Hippocampus from MRI Scans. 
One colab notebook includes the code for just 2D images that are semantically segmented. 
The other colab notebook uses a volume-based MRI dataset and there will be a 2D Unet model that uses slices and a 3D Unet model that uses the whole volume
